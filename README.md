# Personal Expense Tracker App

## Project Description
This is an open-source Python desktop application built with Tkinter for tracking personal expenses, setting budgets, and generating reports. It helps users manage their finances by categorizing expenses, monitoring budgets with alerts, and visualizing spending patterns through charts.
